# Code of Edge effect MS by Liang et al.,2026

# Description

This repository contains the data analysis code and related scripts for the study:
**Mitigating edge effects in paleoclimate reconstructions: a comprehensive review and bias assessment of soil brGDGT-based temperature reconstructions **.
The study quantified the factors contributing to the edge effect and employed a Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDY) approach for dynamic simulation of the brGDGT-based temperature biases.

## **Contents**

The repository includes: Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts used for data analysis and visualization (Figures).
